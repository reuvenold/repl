Thunder<br>
By: Imagine Dragons<br>

Just a young gun, with the quick fuse<br>
Just a young gun with a quick fuse<br>
I was uptight, wanna let loose<br>
I was dreaming of bigger things and<br>
Wanna leave my own life behind<br>
<br>
Not a "Yes sir", not a follower<br>
Fit the box, fit the mold<br>
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number<br>
I was lightning before the thunder<br>
<br>
Thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thun-, thunder
<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder<br>
<br>
Kids were laughing in my classes<br>
While I was scheming for the masses<br>
Who do you think you are?<br>
Dreaming 'bout being a big star<br>
<br>
You say you're basic, you say you're easy<br>
You're always riding in the backseat<br>
Now I'm smiling from the stage while<br>
You were clapping in the nosebleeds<br>
<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-<br>
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thun-, thunder<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder<br>
Thunder<br>
<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder<br>
Lightning and the thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, feel the thunder (feel the)<br>
Lightning and the thunder, thunder<br>
<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-<br>
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-<br>
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-<br>
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
Thunder, thunder, thun-, thunder<br>
Thun-thun-thunder, thunder<br>
